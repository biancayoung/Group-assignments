                    <p>
                        Embedded programming involves writing a program to run on embedded systems, i.e. computing devices 
                        consisting typically of a (micro-)processor, memory and peripheral systems for input/output which is
                        designed to perform dedicated functions within larger systems. During programming, a deep understanding 
                        of hardware constraints is required and good programming skills are beneficial. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A beginner-friendly embedded system is an Arduino board using the Arduino IDE for programming.
                        For this weeks group assignment, we had to fulfil the following assignments:
                    </p>
                </h5>
                <!-- BEGIN: ed8c6549bwf9 -->
                <div class="w3-container w3-card w3-light-grey">

                        <li>Browse through the data sheet for your microcontroller</li>
                        <li>Compare the performance and development workflows for other architectures</li>

                    <p>
                        As the Arduino IDE and its programming language is an easy way to programm a microcontroller, we chose this as 
                        a first instance. In addition, Frauke already used CircuitPython in her individual assignment, therefore we 
                        selected this as a second one.

                    <h1>Arduino IDE</h1>
                    <p>
                        Frauke programmed already two scripts in CircuitPython which both fulfil one part of the individual assignment. 
                        The first script is about interacting with I/O, the second about a serial communication with a host comuputer.
                    </p>

                    
                    <h2>Interacting with I/O</h2>
                    <p> 
                        In order to compare the CircuitPython script of Frauke to an Arduino script, we simply translated 
                        the python code into C++. Here, we simply went through the code line-by-line and translated the 
                        code. It differs only slightly, e.g. the setup has its own loop in Arduino but not so in (Circuit-)Python.
                    </p>

                    <pre style="border: solid 1px #ccc; font-size: 0.85em;"><code>const int buttonPin = D0;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin =  D8;      // the number of the LED pin

int counter = 0;             // counter keeping track of button pushed

unsigned long startTime;      // variable for time when it is started to press the button
unsigned long stopTime;       // variable for time whhen it is stopped to press the button

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);

}

void loop() {
  // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is LOW:
  if (digitalRead(buttonPin) == LOW) {

    // save the time of start pressing
    startTime = millis();

    // Advance counter
    counter = counter +1;
    
    // while the button is continued to being pressed
    while (digitalRead(buttonPin) == LOW){
      delay(100); // do nothing, wait
    }

    // Record time of stop pressing
    stopTime = millis();

    // if button was pressed for less than a second
    if ((stopTime-startTime) < 1000){
      // Blink the LED as many times as the counter
      for (int i = 0; i < counter; i++){
        digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
        delay(150);                  // wait for a second
        digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
        delay(150);                  // wait for a second
      }
    }
    else {
      // Reset counter
      counter = 0;
    }    
  }
}</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        Simply said, this script advances a counter by one every time the button is pressed. Additionally, everytime the 
                        button was pressed, an LED blink as many times as the value of the counter. Lastly, the counter can be reset. 
                        Here, the time between the start and stop of pressing the button 
                        is measured. In case it is longer than one second, the counter is reset to zero, otherwise it is advanced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to the output of the Arduino IDE, this script uses 34252 B of the maximum available 262144 B.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Serial Communication</h2>
                    <p>
                        The second script is about the serial communication between the microcontroller and a host computer. 
                        In case the microcontroller receives the message "1" and LED is switched on, and in case of a "0", the 
                        LED is switched off. This script is the very same that Frauke already used for her individual assignment.
                    </p>

    pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
    
    Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial communication
    while (!Serial); // Wait until Serial is open
    Serial.println("listening..."); // Send that Serial is open and listening
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever

        }
        else if (value == "0"){

                        As for the Arduino IDE, two scripts were programmed in Python, namely the first one regarding the interaction with 
                        input and output and the second one about the serial communication with a host computer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This script is a copy of Frauke's CircuitPython script. It does the very same thing as the first script programmed with Arduino (see above).

                        After saving this in the code.py file on the microcontroller that is configured for CircuitPython, the memory size 
                        it uses is determined by right-clicking on the file and selecting "properites". Here, it says that the file 
                        uses in total 1003 B.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To determine the available memory size of the device, we firstly deleted the script again such that nothing except for the 
                        default files are saved on the microcontroller. Then we right-clicked on the device and selected "properties" as well opening 
                        a small dialog. 
                        Here, it is displayed, that the device has a memory size of 45056 B available.

                        The last script is again about the serial communication written in CircuitPython. It again is a copy of one of Frauke's script 
                        and it achieves the very same behavior as the second script programmed with Arduino (see above).

                        As you can see, the Python scripts consume a lot less memory, i.e. about 13.25% for the Arduino vs. 1.95% for Python. 
                        However, the device has less memory available when configured for CircuitPython. Instead of about 262 KB, the device 
                        only has about 45 KB available. This shows that the configuration for CircuitPython in general take up more memory, e.g. 
                        due to the bootloader.

                        In addition to the memory, we also investigated the performance of the microcontroller during running the script.
                        The first scripts we were using interacted with I/O. As expected, these scripts worked exactly as expected. The LED blinked 
                        as many times as we have pressed the button previously. In addition, the counter can be reset by pressing the button for 
                        more than a second.

                        Potentially, the most obvious difference is the blinking of a blue built-in LED when using the Arduino IDE. 
                        Every time a serial message is received or sent, the blue LED lights up. In addition, the serial communication 
                        with the Arduino IDE take a lot longer. Here, a delay of maybe half a second between sending a message to the microcontroller 
                        and receiving a response from the microcontroller that the message was received by the microcontroller is very obvious
                        for the Arduino IDE. This delay is however not present when using CircuitPython. Also, no blue LED blinks. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Presumably, there is a lot more overhead involved when using the Arduino IDE in contrast to CircuitPython.
                    </p>
                    
                <h2>Development Workflow</h2>
                <p>
                    The development workflows when using the Arduino IDE and C++ vs. CircuitPython is quite different. Here, we listed and compared 
                    the workflows in less detail for an overview. For more details on the exact workflows please refer to  
                    <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/frauke-wassmuth/assignments/assignment06.html">Frauke's</a>
                    individual assignment about embedded programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the Arduino IDE, everything is more or less configured. After opening it, the user only has to set the right 
                    board and port to communicate/upload sketches and maybe install some libraries that are required. The Arduino is 
                    furthermore well developed, maintenance is continuously applied 
                    and support is offered. Therefore, the Arduino IDE is really beginner-friendly and easy to use making it advantageous 
                    over CircuitPython with regards to the aspects above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For CircuitPython, the microcontroller firstly had to be configured to be used with this programming language. When using 
                    basic programming e.g. interacting with I/O, this is nevertheless easily done. After entering the bootloader mode, the 
                    bootloader has to be dragged on the device. For more advanced programming, e.g. serial communication with the host computer, 
                    the IDE has also the be configured for CircuitPython. In this case, we used VS Code, which simply has an extension available 
                    for CircuitPython. This should have been really easy but we ran into an issue with the latest version and had to install a previous 
                    one. However, all-in-all, when using the Arduino IDE, the configuration is very easily achieved, more easily than for 
                    CircuitPython. Furthermore, the CircuitPython community is still growing and gains popularity. However, this also means 
                    that the support is not so ubiquitous and up to date as for Arduino.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When comparing the uploading behaviour, CircuitPython clearly is advantageous over Arduino. For Arduino, a sketch has to be 
                    edited in the Arduino IDE and before uploading, the sketch is verified and compiled. This consumes quite a lot of time in 
                    comparison to CircuitPython. Here, the code.py file on the device can simply be opened with an IDE of your choice (we used 
                    VS Code). Then, the code can be edited and just by saving the code is uploaded to the device. Here, it must be mentioned, that 
                    Python is usually a more compact language than C++. However, it is a preference of the programmer which language to choose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In total, using the Arduino IDE and C++ or CircuitPython are both beneficial in some aspects and disadvantageous in others. 
                    Therefore, it seems to be a choice everybody has to make for themselves.

                    <li>Includes basic peripherals like UART, SPI, I2C, ADCs, timers, and a few GPIOs.</li>

</ul></ul></ul>
<p>The next step was to compare the performance, power consumption, and peripherals with to boards. The board used in the tests above with the SAMD 21 and an Arduino Nano.</p>

<p>We tested the upload time of the code in the Arduino IDE, the power consumption of the board while in sleep mode and the power consumption, when lighting up the LED.</p>
<p>Additionally, we tested the UART (serial communication) of both boards and total time taken to send a specified amount of data over the serial connection as well as power consumption.</p>

<p>Code for the first test:</p>
<pre style="border: solid 1px #ccc; font-size: 0.85em;"><code>

    // Define pins
    const int ledPin = 8;  // LED pin
    
    
    void setup() {
      
      pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  // Set LED pin as output
    }
    
    void loop() {
      // Test 1: Blink LED
      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
      delay(2000);  // 500 ms delay
      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
      delay(2000);  // 500 ms delay
    
     
    }</code></pre>

<p>Code for the second test:</p>
<pre style="border: solid 1px #ccc; font-size: 0.85em;"><code>

    void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);  // Initialize UART
      
      }
      
      void loop() {
      
      
        // Test 2: UART Communication
        unsigned long startTime = millis();
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
          Serial.println("Testing UART communication...");
        }
        unsigned long endTime = millis();
        Serial.print("UART test duration: ");
        Serial.print(endTime - startTime);
        Serial.println(" ms");
      }
</code></pre>
<p>The SAMD21 outperforms the ATmega32 in several key areas. The SAMD21 has significantly faster upload times,
     consuming less power in sleep mode, with an LED connected, and during UART communication. It also demonstrates vastly superior 
     speed in UART communication, making it more efficient and better suited for high-performance, low-power applications. 
</p>    <p>Overall, the SAMD21 offers better performance and power efficiency, making it the preferable choice for modern embedded applications.</p>

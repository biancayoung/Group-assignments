      <h1>3D Printing</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a revolutionary
         technology that has transformed the way we approach design and manufacturing processes.
          Unlike traditional subtractive methods, 3D printing builds objects layer by layer from digital models,
           allowing for intricate and complex shapes that were once challenging or impossible to create. This technology 
           has found applications across various industries, including aerospace, healthcare, automotive, and consumer goods.
            It offers unparalleled flexibility, customization, and rapid prototyping capabilities, making it a powerful tool
             for innovation and production. As 3D printing continues to evolve, it holds the potential to reshape industries 
             and bring about new possibilities in product development and manufacturing.

        <h1>Testing Parameters</h1>
        <p>
          </p>
        <h2>Overhang</h2>
        <p>
        In 3D printing, overhangs refer to portions of a printed object that extend outward at an angle greater than what the printer can bridge without 
        additional support. 
        Printing overhangs without proper support can result in sagging or misshapen layers, negatively affecting the print's quality.</p>
        <p>
        To test overhang performance, a common practice is to print a dedicated overhang test model. This model typically features a series of
         horizontal protrusions at varying angles, gradually increasing in difficulty. </p>
         <p>By systematically testing overhangs, you can fine-tune your printer settings, such as temperature, cooling, and print speed, to achieve better 
            results and expand the range of geometries your 3D printer can successfully produce without compromising quality.</p>
            <p>
            For testing the overhang we used a file from thingiverse <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2806295">(all-in-one test)</a>, that included several tests for parameters described below, which tested 
            overhangs of different length and angle. </p>

                  </div>
        <h2>Tolerance</h2>
        <p>
        Tolerances in 3D printing refer to the permissible variation in the dimensions of a printed object compared to the intended design.
         Achieving accurate tolerances is crucial, especially in functional prints where precise fits and interlocking parts are essential. 
         Testing tolerances helps ensure that the printed object aligns with the design specifications.

        To test tolerances, you can create a calibration model with features designed to evaluate the printer's accuracy. 
        </p><p>
        Regularly testing tolerances and calibrating your 3D printer based on the results will contribute to 
        consistently accurate prints, especially when precision is crucial.</p>
        <p>
            We utilized a dedicated calibration test from thingiverse <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/740643-tolerance-test/files">(tolerance test)</a> to evaluate tolerances for both quadratic and round shapes.</p>

              </div>

        <h2>Anisotropy</h2>
        <p> in 3D printing refers to the directional variation in material properties within a printed object. 
        This phenomenon can occur due to the layer-by-layer additive nature of 3D printing, resulting in different strengths or appearances along different axes.</p><p> 
         Identifying and understanding anisotropy is crucial, especially when structural integrity or surface finish is a priority in the final printed object.</p> 
         <p>We adopted a calibration test featured on the Fabacademy website <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/anisotropy.stl">(anisotropy test)</a>, specifically employing a simple angled structure designed to evaluate 
            the impact of layer building on the breaking surface. The test involves intentionally breaking the printed object at the angled section, allowing us to observe and analyze how the layers influence the position and direction of the fracture. This method provides valuable insights into the layer 
            adhesion and structural integrity of our 3D prints, aiding in the refinement of our printing parameters for enhanced overall performance.

        <h2>Wall Thickness</h2>
        <p>Wall thickness in 3D printing refers to the distance between the outer and inner surfaces of a printed object's walls. It is a crucial parameter,
         as inadequate wall thickness can compromise the structural integrity and functionality of the
         printed model. The appropriate wall thickness depends on factors such as the type of material being used and the intended application of the object.</p>
         <p>We adopted a wall thickness and gap test featured on the thingiverse website <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:420754">(gap and wall thickness test)</a>. This test serves as the purpose for determining 
            optimal wall thickness and gap settings, providing insights that are instrumental in refining our approach for future
            3D printing applications and designs.

        <h2>Bridging</h2>
        <p>Bridging in 3D printing refers to the ability of a printer to create horizontal spans or bridges between two support structures 
            without the need for additional supports. 
        It is a critical aspect of printing complex geometries and can significantly impact the quality and success of a print.</p>
        <p>Testing bridging capabilities is essential for ensuring that a 3D printer can handle intricate geometries and create stable horizontal spans. 
            It is particularly important in designs where support structures would be undesirable or difficult to remove. 
            Regularly testing and optimizing bridging performance contribute to achieving high-quality prints across a variety of applications.</p>
            <p>The bridging test for the printers was incorporated into the "All-In-One" test mentioned before. <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2806295">(all-in-one test)</a></p>

            <div style="text-align: center;">

                  </div>



        <h2>Growing/Shrinking</h2>
        <p>In 3D printing, "growing" or "shrinking" refers to variations in the size of printed objects compared to their digital design dimensions. 
        These deviations can occur due to factors such as material shrinkage, thermal effects, or inaccuracies in printer calibration. 
        Understanding and testing for growing or shrinking is crucial to ensure the printed objects align with the intended specifications.</p>
        <p>By systematically testing for growing or shrinking, you can refine your 3D printer settings to produce prints that closely match the intended 
            dimensions. Regular calibration and adjustments based on testing outcomes contribute to the overall accuracy and reliability of your 3D 
            printing process.</p>
        <p>We have implemented a growing and shrinking test obtained from  ensuring a evaluation of our 3D printers' dimensional 
            accuracy for the used type of material. (What test was that?)</p>

    <h1>Ultimaker S5</h1>
    <p>In the FabLab in Kamp-Lintfort there are several, types and models of printers. The first on we tested for the design rules are the Ultimaker S5, because we can print several 
      things parallel (6 printers).
    </p>
    <p>The main features:
      <ul>
        <li>Filament sensor</li>
        <li>Z-Axis-Resolution of 0.02mm </li>
        <li>Prepared for composite filaments by cured filament drive screw</li>
        <li> Glass front cover for better heat distribution in the interior</li>
        <li>Revised feeder with ball bearing for filament change </li>
        <li>Filament thickness Ø2.85mm</li>
        <li>Live camera & material recognition</li>

      <p>Three of the Ultimaker S5 3D printers of the Lab</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Overhang, Bridging, Growing/Shrinking and Stringing</h2>
    <p>
      In the very beginning, we started with one test piece to print, that is composed of multiple tests claiming to be an
      all-in-one test print. After downloading the file from 
      <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2806295">here</a>, we dragged and dropped the file into the window of the slicer
      <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/">Ultimaker Cura</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, we adjusted the print settings. Here, we used the "Fast 0.2 mm" profile to save some printing time. Additionally, we left the 
      remaining print settings as the default because they usually work well. These are usually a layer height of 0.2 mm, an infill of 15%
      and a triangle pattern,  no supports but a brim for built plate adhesion. The material was furthermore "Generic PLA"
    </p>
    
    <div class="w3-container w3-card w3-light-grey">
      <p>These print settings were used for all prints on the Ultimaker S5 for characterizing the design rules.</p>
    </div>

    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px; vertical-align: top;">

    <div class="w3-container w3-card w3-light-grey">
      <p>The following procedure was applied to all prints on the Ultimaker S5.</p>
    </div>  
    <p>
      After adjusting the print settings in Cura, we pressed "Slice" which generated a machine code, for the Ultimaker in the format 
      of an .ufp file. We exported this to 
      an external flash drive, that we plugged into the 3D printer. Here, we selected the desired file and pressed start. 
    </p>
    <p> Then, the 3D printer did the job all by its own. Before starting the print, it would heat up the nozzle and bed, load some filament, 
      purge some of it as a test and level the bed. The total time of this print was about 2 hours and 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the print being done, we let the 3D printer and the bed cool down for a couple of minutes which made it easier to dismount 
      the 3D printed part form the glass plate. Then, we removed the brim by hand. This is the finished print:

    <h3>Overhang</h3>
    <p> The maximum angle for the overhang can relatively easily be accessed with the test print. Here, overhang with angles between 0° and 80° were 
      tested. From below, it can be seen, that an angle of 50° results in a bad overhang. The face is not smooth anymore but shows distinct filament
      strands that appear "to have fallen". The quality of the overhang proceeds to worsen with increasing angles.

    </div>
    <h3>Bridging</h3>
    <p> Bridging really surprised us. Even the longest bridge with 25 mm length was able to print. However, it shows a small 
      bulge to the bottom. This is also true for most of the other lengths apart from the two smallest ones, namely 2 mm and 5 mm
    </p>
    <p>
      In case the bottom bulge is not relevant, then 25 mm can easily be bridged. However, in case the dimensions must be precise, bridging 
      should not exceed a length of 5 mm.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h3>Growing/Shrinking</h3>
    <p> For assessing the growth of outside dimensions and the shrinkage of the inside dimension, the test print included two 
      hollow cylindrical protrusions with different diameter. The outside diameters were designed to be 8 mm and 6 mm, respectively, 
      with a wall thickness of 1 mm. The inside diameters were hence designed to be 6 mm and 4 mm, respectively. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in reality, these dimensions deviate. We measured the following dimensions
    </p>

    <style>
      table {
        width: 100%;
        border-collapse: collapse;
      }
    
      th, td {
        padding: 8px;
        text-align: left;
        border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
      }
    
      th {
        background-color: #f2f2f2;
      }
    </style>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Cylinder</th>
        <th>Outer &#x2300;, design</th>
        <th>Outer &#x2300;, print</th>
        <th>Inner &#x2300;, design</th>
        <th>Inner &#x2300;, print</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Left (large)</td>
        <td>8.00 mm</td>
        <td>7.75 mm</td>
        <td>6.00 mm</td>
        <td>5.7 mm</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Right (small)</td>
        <td>6.00 mm</td>
        <td>6.1 mm</td>
        <td>4.00 mm</td>
        <td>3.55 mm</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <p>
      For the bigger cylinder, both inside and outside dimensions shrank by about 0.275 mm. For the smaller cylinder however, the inside 
      of the cylinder shrank by 0.45 mm and the outside grew by 0.1 mm. This suggest that the slicer software, Ultimaker Cura, did not compensate 
      for any growth or shrinkage of the 3D prints, at least not to a significant extend.
    </p>

    <p> In total, the deviations might appear small but can be relevant for e.g. press fits and other parts, where tolerances are important.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Stringing</h3>
    <p> Despite the Ultimaker being a good printer, stringing can always be a problem for a good quality print. As we found out with 
      this test print, the Ultimaker is very much prone to stringing.

    <!-- Tolerances -->
    <h2>Tolerances</h2>
    <div style="float: right; margin-right: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">
      <img src="images/Week05/test-cura-tolerances.jpg" alt="Image Description" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
    </div>
    <p>
      Even though the first test piece claimed to be an all-in-one test, there are many other relevant test that should be conducted 
      to better characterize the design rules for the according printer. One of these factors are tolerances. Here, we downloaded an 
      design file from <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/740643-tolerance-test/files">here</a> and printed it with the same 
      settings and procedure as shown above. 
    </p>
    <p> The test piece consist of a grid of circles and rectangles slightly increasing the tolerances from left to right. Additionally, 
      the grid is placed vertically as well. Two pegs that are printed horizontally and vertically, respecitvely, which have are included as well.
    </p>
    <p> The smallest hole which fits the circular side of the vertically printed peg has a tolerance of 0.3 mm, both on the horizontal and 
      vertical grid. The smallest hole for the horizontally printed peg however has a tolerance of 0.2 mm. This is surprising because for this 
      placing, the round part of the peg shows an overhang with high angles in the bottom. 
      <div style="float: right; margin-right: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">
        <img src="images/Week05/ultimaker-tolerances-done.jpg" alt="Image Description" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
      </div>
      However, the layer height of 0.2 mm decreased this effect. Lastly, 
      the vertically printed peg actually shows a relatively big bulge on the top. Maybe, the layer below had not cooled down completely when the 
      next layer was applied inducing a swelling.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p> For the square holes, the smallest tolerance for the horizontally printed peg was 0.2 mm, for the vertically printed however 0.4 mm. 
      In addition, the latter did only fit into the square hole with a tolerance of 0.4 mm on the vertical grid and not on the horizontal one.
      Here, we suspect again the swelling, this time on the bottom of the pieces, both of the peg and the grid. This phenomenon is common in 3D printing
      and is called "elephant's foot". This problem can be overcome by e.g. a better bed levelling, by decreasing the bed temperature by 
      using a raft and/or by adding a chamfer to the model.

    <!-- Anisotropy -->
    <h2>Anisotropy</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the above test pieces, we printed a small "L"-shaped structure that we downloaded 
      <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/anisotropy.stl">here</a>.
      The anisotropy of the print is assessed by breaking the piece and investigating the resulting crack characteristics.
    </p>
    <p> After printing it with the settings and procedures described above, we applied a force on both ends of the piece to break it into two 
      pieces splitting at the inner corner of the "L". It did not need much force and it finally broke apart. As expected, the crack 
      is within the xy-plane, which is parallel to the layers of the 3D print.

    <!-- Gap/Wall Thickness -->
    <h2>Gap Width and Wall Thickness</h2>
    <div style="float: right; margin-right: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">
      <img src="images/Week05/test-cura-gap-wall.jpg" alt="Image Description" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
    </div>
    <p>
      As a last test print to characterize the design rules of the Ultimaker S5, we decided on assessing the minimum gap width and wall thicknesses 
      to be able to print. For this, we downloaded an .stl file from 
      <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:420754">here</a> and printed it with the settings and procedures described above. 
    </p>
    <p> After dismounting the printed parts from the bed, we investigated the print quality. The part for the gap width test for example 
      shows all gaps, even the smallest one with a thickness of 0.2 mm. However, the smallest gap is so small, it may be already closed by 
      a thin but yet transparent layer of PLA.
    </p>
    <p>
      When investigating the quality of wall printing, we were quite surprised as even the smallest wall with a thickness of 0.2 mm was printed 
      by the Ultimaker S5. Usually, traces that would be smaller than the nozzle, are not included in the slicing and thus not in the print. 
      However, this print states the contrary as the nozzle size is 0.4 mm and a wall with 0.2 mm thickness was printed. We suspect that the 
      speed of the print in combination with the speed of purging might affect the thickness of the printed filament. This theory might be supported 
      by the thicker ends of the smallest wall.

       In addition to the Ultimaker S5, the FabLab has various other printers. However, the most popular one is the Prusa i3 MKS3+ and 
       we will probably use the Prusa for the individual assignments as well. Therefore, we focused on this 3D printer as a second one 
       characterizing the design rules.

      <h1>3D Printing</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a revolutionary
         technology that has transformed the way we approach design and manufacturing processes.
          Unlike traditional subtractive methods, 3D printing builds objects layer by layer from digital models,
           allowing for intricate and complex shapes that were once challenging or impossible to create. This technology 
           has found applications across various industries, including aerospace, healthcare, automotive, and consumer goods.
            It offers unparalleled flexibility, customization, and rapid prototyping capabilities, making it a powerful tool
             for innovation and production. As 3D printing continues to evolve, it holds the potential to reshape industries 
             and bring about new possibilities in product development and manufacturing.

        <h1>Testing Parameters</h1>
        <p>In the FabLab in Kamp-Lintfort there are several, types and models of printers. The first on we tested for the design rules are the Ultimaker S5, because we can print several 
            things parallel (6 printers).
          </p>
        <h2>Overhang</h2>
        <p>
        In 3D printing, overhangs refer to portions of a printed object that extend outward at an angle greater than what the printer can bridge without 
        additional support. 
        Printing overhangs without proper support can result in sagging or misshapen layers, negatively affecting the print's quality.</p>
        <p>
        To test overhang performance, a common practice is to print a dedicated overhang test model. This model typically features a series of
         horizontal protrusions at varying angles, gradually increasing in difficulty. </p>
         <p>
            For testing the overhang we used a file from (?), that included several tests for parameters described below, which tested overhangs of different length and angle. </p>

      <p>Three of the Ultimaker S5 3D printers of the Lab</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Overhang, Bridging, Growing/Shrinking and Stringing</h2>
    <p>
      In the very beginning, we started with one test piece to print, that is composed of multiple tests claiming to be an
      all-in-one test print. After downloading the file from 
      <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2806295">here</a>, we dragged and dropped the file into the window of the slicer
      <a href="https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/">Ultimaker Cura</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, we adjusted the print settings. Here, we used the "Fast 0.2 mm" profile to save some printing time. Additionally, we left the 
      remaining print settings as the default because they usually work well. These are usually a layer height of 0.2 mm, an infill of 15%
      and a triangle pattern,  no supports but a brim for built plate adhesion. The material was furthermore "Generic PLA"
    </p>
    
    <div class="w3-container w3-card w3-light-grey">
      <p>These print settings were used for all prints on the Ultimaker S5 for characterizing the design rules</p>
    </div>
    <p>

    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">

    <div class="w3-container w3-card w3-light-grey">
      <p>The following procedure was applied to all prints on the Ultimaker S5.</p>
    </div>  
    <p>
      After adjusting the print settings in Cura, we pressed "Slice" which generated a machine code, for the Ultimaker in the format 
      of an .ufp file. We exported this to 
      an external flash drive, that we plugged into the 3D printer. Here, we selected the desired file and pressed start. 
    </p>
    <p> Then, the 3D printer did the job all by its own. Before starting the print, it would heat up the nozzle and bed, load some filament, 
      purge some of it as a test and level the bed. The total time of this print was about 2 hours and 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the print being done, we let the 3D printer and the bed cool down for a couple of minutes which made it easier to dismount 
      the 3D printed part form the glass plate. Then, we removed the brim by hand. This is the finished print:

    </div>
    <h3>Overhang</h3>
    <p> The maximum angle for the overhang can relatively easily be accessed with the test print. Here, overhang with angles between 0° and 80° were 
      tested. From below, it can be seen, that an angle of 50° results in a bad overhang. The face is not smooth anymore but shows distinct filament
      strands that appear "to have fallen". The quality of the overhang proceeds to worsen with increasing angles.
    </p>

      <img src="images/Week05/ultimaker-multiple-bridging.jpg" style="width: 273px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
    </div>
    <h3>Bridging</h3>
    <p> Bridging really surprised us. Even the longest bridge with 25 mm length was able to print. However, it shows a small 
      bulge to the bottom. This is also true for most of the other lengths apart from the two smallest ones, namely 2 mm and 5 mm
    </p>
    <p>
      In case the bottom bulge is not relevant, then 25 mm can easily be bridged. However, in case the dimensions must be precise, bridging 
      should not exceed a length of 5 mm.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h3>Growing/Shrinking</h3>
    <p> For assessing the growth of outside dimensions and the shrinkage of the inside dimension, the test print included two 
      hollow cylindrical protrusions with different diameter. The outside diameters were designed to be 8 mm and 6 mm, respectively, 
      with a wall thickness of 1 mm. The inside diameters were hence designed to be 6 mm and 4 mm, respectively. 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in reality,
      these dimensions deviate. We measured .... INSERT MEASUREMENTS!
    </p>
    <p> In total, the deviations might appear small but can be relevant for e.g. press fits and other parts, where tolerances are important.</p>

      <img src="images/Week05/ultimaker-multiple-stringing.jpg" style="width: 273px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
    </div>
    <h3>Stringing</h3>
    <p> Despite the Ultimaker being a good printer, stringing can always be a problem for a good quality print. As we found out with 
      this test print, the Ultimaker is very much prone to stringing.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>
    

    <!-- Tolerances -->
    <h2>Tolerances</h2>
    <div style="float: right; margin-right: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">
      <img src="images/Week05/test-cura-tolerances.jpg" alt="Image Description" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
    </div>
    <p>
      Even though the first test piece claimed to be an all-in-one test, there are many other relevant test that should be conducted 
      to better characterize the design rules for the according printer. One of these factors are tolerances. Here, we downloaded an 
      design file from <a href="https://www.printables.com/de/model/740643-tolerance-test/files">here</a> and printed it with the same 
      settings and procedure as shown above. 
    </p>
    <p> The test piece consist of a grid of circles and rectangles slightly increasing the tolerances from left to right. Additionally, 
      the grid is placed vertically as well. Two pegs that are printed horizontally and vertically, respecitvely, which have are included as well.
    </p>
    <p> The smallest hole which fits the circular side of the vertically printed peg has a tolerance of 0.3 mm, both on the horizontal and 
      vertical grid. The smallest hole for the horizontally printed peg however has a tolerance of 0.2 mm. This is surprising because for this 
      placing, the round part of the peg shows an overhang with high angles in the bottom. 
      <div style="float: right; margin-right: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">
        <img src="images/Week05/ultimaker-tolerances-done.jpg" alt="Image Description" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
      </div>
      However, the layer height of 0.2 mm decreased this effect. Lastly, 
      the vertically printed peg actually shows a relatively big bulge on the top. Maybe, the layer below had not cooled down completely when the 
      next layer was applied inducing a swelling.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p> For the square holes, the smallest tolerance for the horizontally printed peg was 0.2 mm, for the vertically printed however 0.4 mm. 
      In addition, the latter did only fit into the square hole with a tolerance of 0.4 mm on the vertical grid and not on the horizontal one.
      Here, we suspect again the swelling, this time on the bottom of the pieces, both of the peg and the grid. This phenomenon is common in 3D printing
      and is called "elephant's foot". This problem can be overcome by e.g. a better bed levelling, by decreasing the bed temperature by 
      using a raft and/or by adding a chamfer to the model.
    </p>

    <!-- Anisotropy -->
    <h2>Anisotropy</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the above test pieces, we printed a small "L"-shaped structure that we downloaded 
      <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/scanning_printing/anisotropy.stl">here</a>.
      The anisotropy of the print is assessed by breaking the piece and investigating the resulting crack characteristics.
    </p>
    <p> After printing it with the settings and procedures described above, we applied a force on both ends of the piece to break it into two 
      pieces splitting at the inner corner of the "L". It did not need much force and it finally broke apart. As expected, the crack 
      is within the xy-plane, which is parallel to the layers of the 3D print.
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <div style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px; vertical-align: top;">

    <!-- Gap/Wall Thickness -->
    <h2>Gap Width and Wall Thickness</h2>
    <div style="float: right; margin-right: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px;">
      <img src="images/Week05/test-cura-gap-wall.jpg" alt="Image Description" style="width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
    </div>
    <p>
      As a last test print to characterize the design rules of the Ultimaker S5, we decided on assessing the minimum gap width and wall thicknesses 
      to be able to print. For this, we downloaded an .stl file from 
      <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:420754">here</a> and printed it with the settings and procedures described above.

       In addition to the Ultimaker S5, the FabLab has various other printers. However, the most popular one is the Prusa i3 MKS3+ and 
       we will probably use the Prusa for the individual assignments as well. Therefore, we focused on this 3D printer as a second one

                        As this week is about networking and communication, we had an assignment to complete that
                        regarded different
                        communication protocols between mircocontroller. Here, the assignment were:

                        In our case, we concentrated on the two protocols UART and I<sub>2</sub>C.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UART stands for "Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter", where two wires are used
                        unidirectional to send a message to
                        and receive a message from another device, respectively. In I<sup>2</sup>C, which is an
                        abbreviation for Inter-Integrated
                        Circuit, the wires are used for a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). It can
                        be communicated with various
                        devices by using addresses. However, only one master node can exists. The remaining ones are
                        slave nods. Nowadays, these
                        nodes are also called primary and secondary.

                <p>
                    For I<sub>2</sub>C, we firstly searched online for an exemplary script that employs this
                    communication protocol between two Arduino
                    boards. Here, we found <a href="https://www.instructables.com/I2C-between-Arduinos/">this</a>
                    website. We basically followed
                    the instructions on the website. For this, we firstly programmed the boards. Upon reading and trying
                    to understand the code,
                    we discovered some minor errors in the code supplied by the website. However, they were easily
                    discovered. Therefore, we
                    uploaded firstly the following master code to an Arduino Nano.
                </p>
                <pre style="border: solid 1px #ccc; font-size: 0.85em;"><code>
    // Include the required Wire library for I2C<br>
    #include &lt;Wire.h&gt;
    
    int x = 0;
    
    void setup() {
        // Start the I2C Bus as Master
        Wire.begin();   
    }
    
    void loop() {
        Wire.beginTransmission(9); // transmit to device #9
        Wire.write(x);             // sends x 
        Wire.endTransmission();    // stop transmitting
        
        x++; // Advance x
        if (x > 5) x = 0; // reset x once it gets 6
        delay(1000);
    }
                
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    After that we uploaded the following code, i.e. the slave code, to an Arduino Uno.
                </p>
                <pre style="border: solid 1px #ccc; font-size: 0.85em;"><code>
    // Include the required Wire library for I2C
    #include &lt;Wire.h&gt;
    int LED = 13;
    int x = 0;

    void setup() {  
        // Define the LED pin as Output
        pinMode (LED, OUTPUT);
        
        // Start the I2C Bus as Slave on address 9
        Wire.begin(9); 
        
        // Attach a function to trigger when something is received.
        Wire.onReceive(receiveEvent);
    }

    void receiveEvent(int bytes) {
        x = Wire.read();    // read one character from the I2C
    }

    void loop() {
        //If value received is 0 blink LED for 200 ms
        if (x == 0) {
            digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
            delay(200);
            digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
            delay(200);
            Serial.println("Blink LED");
        }
        //If value received is 3 blink LED for 400 ms
        if (x == 3) {
            digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
            delay(400);
            digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
            delay(400);
            Serial.println("Blink LED");
        }
    }
                                
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    Next, we connected the SCL pin of the Arduino Nano to the SCL pin of the Arduino Nano and the
                    according SDA pins.
                    Then, we also connected the 5 V and GND pins to the according one on the other board. Lastly, we had
                    to connect a power source
                    to the Arduino Uno or Nano with a cable. After plugging it into a socket, we obtained the expected
                    behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we obtained a working system, we proceeded with the board, that

                    made during the electronics design week.
                    For this, we adapted did not have to adapt anything in the code. The master node was Frauke's board
                    where the code did not
                    require any pin declarations. For the slave node, i.e. Sophia's board, the code had one pin
                    declaration but the LED pin
                    was the very same as for the Arduino Nano.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we also proceeded with just uploading the codes using programmer boards. For the details
                    please refer to either
                    <a

                        Frauke's</a> or

                        Sophia's</a> documentation. Lastly, we also connected the SCL, SDA, 5 V and ground pins and
                    powered the boards using a the
                    USB hub of a computer. This resulted in the same behavior as for the Arduinos, namely an LED that
                    blinks relatively
                    fast three times, is off, blinks relatively slow two times and lastly is off again until these
                    phases repeat.

                    made during the electronics production week which bears a Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21 chip.
                    The code was only adjusted slightly, i.e. the pin declaration for the LED in the slave code was
                    changed to

                <pre style="border: solid 1px #ccc; font-size: 0.85em;"><code>
                    
    int LED = 8;

                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    Then, we again connected the boards and powered them as described above. However, we were not able
                    to see the expected
                    blinking behavior. Therefore, we implemented the <code>Serial.begin(9600);</code> in the
                    <code>setup()</code> function
                    of the master code. Next, instead of ending the I<sub>2</sub>C transmission with
                    <code>Wire.endTransmission();</code>
                    we changed the line to the following:
                </p>
                <pre style="border: solid 1px #ccc; font-size: 0.85em;"><code>

                <p>
                    Upon opening the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE, the <code>Wire.endTransmission();</code>
                    apparently returned the

                    <li>
                        Incorrect I2C Address: Make sure that you are using the correct I2C address for the slave
                        device. Double-check the address specified in your code against the address provided in the
                        datasheet or documentation of the device.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Missing or Misconnected Pull-up Resistors: Ensure that pull-up resistors are correctly connected
                        to both the SDA and SCL lines of the I2C bus. Pull-up resistors are essential for proper
                        communication on the I2C bus. Without them, the bus lines may not reach the high logic level
                        properly, leading to communication errors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Problem with the Slave Device: The slave device may not be functioning correctly or may not be
                        properly connected to the I2C bus. Check the connections and ensure that the slave device is
                        powered and properly initialized.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bus Capacitance or Noise: High bus capacitance or electrical noise on the I2C bus can cause
                        communication issues, including NACK errors. Minimize long wire lengths and avoid routing I2C
                        lines near sources of electrical noise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clock Speed: Ensure that the clock speed of your I2C communication is compatible with the slave
                        device. Some devices may have limitations on the maximum clock speed they can support.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Device Busy: The slave device may be busy processing a previous command and unable to respond to
                        the address sent by the master. Ensure that the slave device has completed any previous
                        operations before initiating a new communication.
                    </li>
                    <p></p>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    From this list of error causes, we ruled out most of them as the code was working fine with the other boards
                    and due to the fact.However, we were left with the cause "Missing or Misconnected Pull-up Resistors". Therefore, 
                    we tried connecting the SCL and SDA pin high with a 10 kiloohm pull-up resistor, respectively, by using a breadboard.
                    And this actually worked!

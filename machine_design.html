                <h2>Linear Motion System</h2>
                <p>In this chapter the design and fabrication of the linear motion system is shortly described. For any
                  further information have a look into the individual page of
                  <a
                    href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/sophia-doring/assignments/10MechanicalDMachineD.html">
                    Sophia DÃ¶ring.</a>
                </p>
                <p>The linear motion system enables the movement of the pen holder along the y.axis of the machine.
                  There are several principles and designs existing to create linear motion.
                  For the design we defined these specified requirements:
                <ol>
                  <li>The linear motion of the rail must be a translation of the rotational movement generated by a NEMA
                    17 stepper motor</li>
                  <li>The linear motion rail must offer high precision to ensure accurate movement of the pen along one
                    degree of freedom</li>
                  <li>Smooth motion is essential to prevent any jerky movements or inconsistencies in the plotted lines.
                  </li>
                  <li>The linear motion rail should provide secure attachment points or mounting options to the frame
                  </li>
                  <li>While meeting all the necessary requirements, the linear motion rail should also be cost-effective
                  </li>


                </ol>

                As a spindle nut system with 1:1 gear ration to a stepper motor is common for plotter machine and 3D
                printers as well as meeting all the requirements, this system was
                chosen for moving the pen holder. Additionally, to constrain any other degree of freedom a slider-rail
                system was chosen, also satisfying the defined requirements.</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">

                  <img src="images/Week10/Shaftrail.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
                </div>
                <p>The rail system was not fabricated in the lab as only off-shelf components were used for the system.
                </p>
                <p>Utilizing resources available in the lab, I opted to incorporate a linear bearing and shaft to
                  constrain the degrees
                  of freedom. I proceeded by reverse-engineering
                  the critical dimensions of both the linear bearing and the shaft, were they would be connected to the
                  penholder and the frame.</p>

                <h2>Pen Holder</h2>
                <p>
                  The pen holder of the egg painting machine should - as the name says - hold the pen such that the tip
                  is in contact with the egg shell.
                  In the first meeting about the general layout of the egg painting machine, we already described some
                  basics about the pen holder and the
                  interfaces with the other teams. These are for example, that it will be moved by the translation stage
                  and therefore needs to be attached
                  to it and its parts. It should furthermore position the tip of the pen on the eggs shell.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are many things that need to be considered before designing the pen holder. Some major aspects
                  are the method of how to retract the
                  pen, the contact pressure and the vertical travel it should be able to accomplish. In general, the
                  requirements for the pne holder were
                  specified to the following.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Attach to translation stage</li>
                  <li>Retractable with a servo motor</li>
                  <li>Tip of pen touches the egg shell on the top</li>
                  <li>Contact pressure between min. 0.5 N and max. 2 N</li>
                  <li>Allows for a vertical travel of 20 mm</li>
                  <li>Pen diameters are max. 18 mm</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  For the details on the design decisions, please refer to
                  <a
                    href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/frauke-wassmuth/assignments/assignment10.html">Frauke's
                    documentation</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The design itself is relatively simple. There is a part that stands vertically and mounts to the
                  translation stage consisting of
                  a linear slide and a threaded rod with a nut. In the top of the
                  part, a hinge is present which connects to another part, which is referred to as the lever arm. On its
                  end, the pen is mounted. With the hinge,
                  the pen itself can be moved up and down in a slightly curved movement. On the lever arm, a slot is
                  present to be able to attach some weight to
                  it to precisely adjust the contact pressure. Without the weight, the tip of the pen is loaded with
                  about 0.5 N, depending on the weight of the pen.
                  This is how the design looks like:
                </p>
                <div
                  style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px; vertical-align: top;">
                  <img src="images/Week10/pen-holder-right.jpg" style="width: 49%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
                  <img src="images/Week10/pen-holder-left.jpg" style="width: 49%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
                </div>
                <p>
                  As these parts are highly customized, these parts were 3D printed with PLA on a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon
                  with support structures from PLA.
                  To ease the removal of the support, three layers of the interface between the support and the actual
                  print were printed from PETG. In the
                  images below, you can see the PLA in black and PETG in green in the slicer software Bambu Studio.
                </p>
                <div
                  style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px; vertical-align: top;">
                  <img src="images/Week10/mount-sliced1.jpg" style="width: 49%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
                  <img src="images/Week10/leverarm-sliced2.jpg" style="width: 49%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
                </div>
                <p>
                  After the print was completed, the support structures were removed. After this, the assembly could
                  start. Firstly, the two bearings were pressed
                  into the positions at the hinge. The tolerances here were big enough to easily press it in without
                  breaking the part. Next, the hinge was completed
                  by inserting a 5 mm rod through it. Then, the servo was positioned between the arms and attached with
                  two M3x12 screws.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, the pen holder was mounted onto the translation stage. The first step was to tighten the
                  screws in the bottom that mount it to the linear
                  slider. Then, the nut that is mounted to the threaded rod that generates the motion is attached to the
                  pen holder. In the end, the threaded rod
                  is inserted through the hole of the pen holder and screwed into the nut. This finished the assembly.

                <h2>Frame</h2>
                <p>The frame is the component to align and position all other components. Therefore, these requirements
                  were defined:
                <ol>
                  <li>The frame must incorporate designated mounting points to seamlessly accommodate the linear motion
                    system, egg holder, and electronics. This ensures precise alignment and ease of assembly.</li>
                  <li>It is imperative that the frame offers robust stability to securely hold all components in place
                    during operation</li>
                  <li>The frame design should incorporate a user-friendly system allowing for easy adjustment of the egg
                    holder's length</li>
                  <li>The frame should be lightweight and compact enough to be comfortably carried by two hands,
                    facilitating relocation and deployment in different settings</li>
                  <li>The frame design should prioritize simplicity and ease of fabrication to minimize production time
                  </li>
                  <li> Opting for materials and manufacturing techniques that strike a balance between affordability and
                    performance ensures that the frame remains budget-friendly without compromising on quality or
                    functionality.</li>


                </ol>
                The design was created in Fusion360. As tool of fabrication we decided to use laser cutting and 3D
                printing.
                The design was split up in two parts as the length adjustment system of the egg holder provided a point
                of complexisity in the design of the frame.
                </p>
                <p>The adjustable length system was design by <a

                    Sophia DÃ¶ring</a>. For any
                  further information of the design look on her individual page. The additional requirements for this
                  part of the frame were defined as:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The system must be capable of adjusting to a length of 55 mm</li>

                    Ece</a> started with the design. However, as she was unavailable for the second half of the
                  assignment,
                  <a

                  proceeded with the design. Some major changes from other teams were also made in the second half of the assignment which
                  is why only the spatial dimensions of the interface with other teams were carried over to Frauke's work. Also, time
                  was a major factor, which is why the majority of the frame was designed to be manufactured really quickly.
                  Here, the lasercutter was used for the design.

                <p>
                  Also, because of time-issues, the design was quite simple. In principle, consists of a baseplate, which is elevated by some 
                  3D printed feet at the corner and some under the plate as well. This allows to attach something with bolts and nuts to
                  the baseplate. On top of it, There are several lasercut mounts, e.g. for the two stepper motors and bearings. These are also 
                  lasercut and joined with the baseplate via finger joints. To further stabilize them, several sheets of materials are used for
                  mounts and 3D printed angle stabilizers are used. Lastly, the rail slide for the egg holder can be mounted with several screws.
                  The image shows the design of the frame. It accounts for kerf and the thickness of the material with parameters

                  The majority of the parts were laser cut on the smaller Epilog laser in our lab with the auto-focus feature from 4mm plywood. 
                  After exporting the faces of all lasercut parts from fusion as .svg files, they were opened at the computer connected to the laser 
                  and send to the laser software as a print. In this software, the parts were cut with the vector cuts with the settings for 20 as speed, 
                  90 as power and 17 as frequency. These are the settings we found optimal for this material during our 
                  <a href="computer_controlled_cutting.html">lasercutting assignment</a>. The value for the kerf used in the design was also 
                  taken from there.

                  The 3D printed parts were printed on several printers at the same time to speed the manufacturing process up. In general, the bodies 
                  were exported as .stl files and imported to the slicer software. They were printed with a standard printing profiles. For the 
                  Ultimaker S5, the "Normal - 0.15 mm" profile was used and for the Prusa MK3 the "0.15mm QUALITY" profile. All parts were printed without 
                  supports

                <p>
                  After the manufacturing, we could assemble everything. This was done by inserting the laser cut mounts onto the baseplate and fixing their 
                  position with the corner stabilizers. Next, the rail slide was mounted and lastly the feet. The photo below already shows the egg holder, the 
                  translation stage and the pen holder in place.

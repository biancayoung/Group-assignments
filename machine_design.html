          <h1>Planning and Allocation of Tasks</h1>
          <p>
            To build the egg painting machine, several tasks have to be accomplished. These are roughly divided into two categories, namely the 
            electronics, i.e. designing and manufacturing the PCB, and the mechanical parts including a linear motion system, a pen holder, an egg holder 
            and a frame that holds all the parts together. The actual programming and testing the complete machine was planned to be done by all of us 
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the four of us doing FabAcademy in Kamp-Lintfort, we had one person from the FabLab Bottrop joining us. Therefore, we were 
            five people such that a single task could be allocated to a single person. Here, Jona from Bottrop choose the electronics design task as this is 
            his profession and this had the least interfaces with other tasks. The remaining task were split among the KaLi people. In total, the tasks 
            were allocated as follows:

            Planning-wise we did not create any chart to visually show when task had to be done. However, there were several aspects we agreed on regarding 
            time management for planning.

                <h2>Linear Motion System</h2>
                <p>In this chapter the design and fabrication of the linear motion system is shortly described. For any
                  further information have a look into the individual page of
                  <a
                    href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/sophia-doring/assignments/10MechanicalDMachineD.html">

                </p>
                <p>The linear motion system enables the movement of the pen holder along the y.axis of the machine.
                  There are several principles and designs existing to create linear motion.
                  For the design we defined these specified requirements:
                <ol>
                  <li>The linear motion of the rail must be a translation of the rotational movement generated by a NEMA
                    17 stepper motor</li>
                  <li>The linear motion rail must offer high precision to ensure accurate movement of the pen along one
                    degree of freedom</li>
                  <li>Smooth motion is essential to prevent any jerky movements or inconsistencies in the plotted lines.
                  </li>
                  <li>The linear motion rail should provide secure attachment points or mounting options to the frame
                  </li>
                  <li>While meeting all the necessary requirements, the linear motion rail should also be cost-effective
                  </li>


                </ol>

                As a spindle nut system with 1:1 gear ration to a stepper motor is common for plotter machine and 3D
                printers as well as meeting all the requirements, this system was
                chosen for moving the pen holder. Additionally, to constrain any other degree of freedom a slider-rail
                system was chosen, also satisfying the defined requirements.</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">

                </div>
                <p>The rail system was not fabricated in the lab as only off-shelf components were used for the system.
                </p>
                <p>Utilizing resources available in the lab, I opted to incorporate a linear bearing and shaft to
                  constrain the degrees
                  of freedom. I proceeded by reverse-engineering
                  the critical dimensions of both the linear bearing and the shaft, were they would be connected to the
                  penholder and the frame.</p>

                <h2>Pen Holder</h2>
                <p>
                  The pen holder of the egg painting machine should - as the name says - hold the pen such that the tip
                  is in contact with the egg shell.
                  In the first meeting about the general layout of the egg painting machine, we already described some
                  basics about the pen holder and the
                  interfaces with the other teams. These are for example, that it will be moved by the translation stage
                  and therefore needs to be attached
                  to it and its parts. It should furthermore position the tip of the pen on the eggs shell.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are many things that need to be considered before designing the pen holder. Some major aspects
                  are the method of how to retract the
                  pen, the contact pressure and the vertical travel it should be able to accomplish. In general, the
                  requirements for the pne holder were
                  specified to the following.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Attach to translation stage</li>
                  <li>Retractable with a servo motor</li>
                  <li>Tip of pen touches the egg shell on the top</li>
                  <li>Contact pressure between min. 0.5 N and max. 2 N</li>
                  <li>Allows for a vertical travel of 20 mm</li>
                  <li>Pen diameters are max. 18 mm</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  For the details on the design decisions, please refer to
                  <a
                    href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/frauke-wassmuth/assignments/assignment10.html">Frauke's
                    documentation</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The design itself is relatively simple. There is a part that stands vertically and mounts to the
                  translation stage consisting of
                  a linear slide and a threaded rod with a nut. In the top of the
                  part, a hinge is present which connects to another part, which is referred to as the lever arm. On its
                  end, the pen is mounted. With the hinge,
                  the pen itself can be moved up and down in a slightly curved movement. On the lever arm, a slot is
                  present to be able to attach some weight to
                  it to precisely adjust the contact pressure. Without the weight, the tip of the pen is loaded with
                  about 0.5 N, depending on the weight of the pen.
                  This is how the design looks like:
                </p>
                <div
                  style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px; vertical-align: top;">
                  <img src="images/Week10/pen-holder-right.jpg" style="width: 49%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
                  <img src="images/Week10/pen-holder-left.jpg" style="width: 49%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
                </div>
                <p>
                  As these parts are highly customized, these parts were 3D printed with PLA on a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon
                  with support structures from PLA.
                  To ease the removal of the support, three layers of the interface between the support and the actual
                  print were printed from PETG. In the
                  images below, you can see the PLA in black and PETG in green in the slicer software Bambu Studio.
                </p>
                <div
                  style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px; vertical-align: top;">
                  <img src="images/Week10/mount-sliced1.jpg" style="width: 49%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
                  <img src="images/Week10/leverarm-sliced2.jpg" style="width: 49%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
                </div>
                <p>
                  After the print was completed, the support structures were removed. After this, the assembly could
                  start. Firstly, the two bearings were pressed
                  into the positions at the hinge. The tolerances here were big enough to easily press it in without
                  breaking the part. Next, the hinge was completed
                  by inserting a 5 mm rod through it. Then, the servo was positioned between the arms and attached with
                  two M3x12 screws.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, the pen holder was mounted onto the translation stage. The first step was to tighten the
                  screws in the bottom that mount it to the linear
                  slider. Then, the nut that is mounted to the threaded rod that generates the motion is attached to the
                  pen holder. In the end, the threaded rod
                  is inserted through the hole of the pen holder and screwed into the nut. This finished the assembly.

                <h2>Egg Holder</h2>
                <p>
                    The egg holder is composed of two parts: one that is controlled by the motor and spins the egg, and the other that helps hold the egg up and follows the spinning motion
                  The requirements for the egg holder were defined as:
                </p>
                
                <ol>
                   <li>Hold the egg without any adhesive</li>
                   <li>Connect to the motor</li>
                   <li>Spin the egg</li>
                   <li>Adjust for the different egg sizes</li></ol>

                <p>
                  The design of the egg holder was done in Fusion 360, and the components were either sourced at the lab (nuts, screws, spring, rods, bearings) or 3D printed (egg holding parts).
                  The design and assembly of this was done by <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/bianca-guimaraes/athwssignments/10-mechanical-design-and-machine-design.html">Bianca Guimarães</a>, and more in-depth information can be found on her individual page.

                  The design of this part went through a few different versions until a final version was decided upon. The tricky part was to make sure the egg would stay in place while spinning, but in general, the design is actually quite simple. The part that's connected to the motor is just that, a solid 3D printed part with a small crater where the tip of the egg sits on, and on the other end, the place where the motor shaft is inserted and secured with a screw and nut.</p>

                <h2>Frame</h2>
                <p>The frame is the component to align and position all other components. Therefore, these requirements
                  were defined:
                <ol>
                  <li>The frame must incorporate designated mounting points to seamlessly accommodate the linear motion
                    system, egg holder, and electronics. This ensures precise alignment and ease of assembly.</li>
                  <li>It is imperative that the frame offers robust stability to securely hold all components in place
                    during operation</li>
                  <li>The frame design should incorporate a user-friendly system allowing for easy adjustment of the egg
                    holder's length</li>
                  <li>The frame should be lightweight and compact enough to be comfortably carried by two hands,
                    facilitating relocation and deployment in different settings</li>
                  <li>The frame design should prioritize simplicity and ease of fabrication to minimize production time
                  </li>
                  <li> Opting for materials and manufacturing techniques that strike a balance between affordability and
                    performance ensures that the frame remains budget-friendly without compromising on quality or
                    functionality.</li>
                </ol>
                The design was created in Fusion360. Designing the frame as a task was allocated to <a
                  href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/ece-oner/weekly_assignments/week_10.html">
                  Ece</a>. She started with the design. However, as she was unavailable for the second half of the
                assignment,
                <a
                  href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/frauke-wassmuth/assignments/assignment10.html">Frauke
                </a> and

                    Sophia </a> proceeded with the design.

                <h3>Frame 2.0</h3>
                <p>
                  Some major changes from other teams were made in the second half of the assignment as we had designed out parts with part we wanted to buy. 
                  Instead of buying these, we discovered that we had some similar components already available. Even though they were similar, this 
                  resulted in a lot of redesigning the parts. Here, the design of the frame was affected in such a way that it had to be remodelled drastically. 
                  However, Ece got unavailable in the second week, <a
                  href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/frauke-wassmuth/assignments/assignment10.html">Frauke
                </a> and

                    Sophia </a> proceeded and created the frame 2.0 design.
                  
                </p>
                <p>
                  The design was split up in two parts as the length adjustment system of the egg holder provided a point
                  of complexity in the design of the frame. These two parts are named length adjustment system and the remaining frame.
                </p>
                <p>The adjustable length system was design by <a
                    href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/sophia-doring/assignments/10MechanicalDMachineD.html">
                    Sophia Döring</a>. For any
                  further information of the design look on her individual page. The additional requirements for this
                  part of the frame were defined as:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The system must be capable of adjusting to a length of 55 mm</li>
                  <li>Tolerance for adjustment should be within 5 mm</li>
                  <li>User-friendly</li>
                  <li>Stability is essential to support the weight of an egg without risk of tipping</li>
                  <li>Should withstand the forces from the spring forces (egg holder)</li>

                </ol>
                <p>As design a simple rail slide system was incorporated with the functionality of rotating the slide in
                  a way to interlock with the rail.</p>
                <p> The design was created in Fusion360 and fabricated with 3D printing using an Ultimaker S5 and an Ender 3 v2.</p>

                  The remaining frame 2.0 design was done by 
                  <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/frauke-wassmuth/assignments/assignment10.html">
                  Frauke</a>. In her design, time was a major factor, which is why the majority of the frame was designed to be manufactured quickly.
                  Here, the choice of the manufacturing process fell on lasercutter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also, because of time-issues, the design was quite simple. In principle, consists of a baseplate, which is elevated by some 
                  3D printed feet at the corner and some under the plate as well. This allows to attach something with bolts and nuts to
                  the baseplate. On top of it, There are several lasercut mounts, e.g. for the two stepper motors and bearings. These are also 
                  lasercut and joined with the baseplate via finger joints. To further stabilize them, several sheets of materials are used for
                  mounts and 3D printed angle stabilizers are used. Lastly, the rail slide for the egg holder can be mounted with several screws.
                  The image shows the design of the frame. It accounts for kerf and the thickness of the material with parameters

                <p>
                  The majority of the parts were laser cut on the smaller Epilog laser in our lab with the auto-focus feature from 4mm plywood. 
                  After exporting the faces of all lasercut parts from fusion as .svg files, they were opened at the computer connected to the laser 
                  and send to the laser software as a print. In this software, the parts were cut with the vector cuts with the settings for 20 as speed, 
                  90 as power and 17 as frequency. These are the settings we found optimal for this material during our 
                  <a href="computer_controlled_cutting.html">lasercutting assignment</a>. The value for the kerf used in the design was also 
                  taken from there.

                  The 3D printed parts were printed on several printers at the same time to speed the manufacturing process up. In general, the bodies 
                  were exported as .stl files and imported to the slicer software. They were printed with a standard printing profiles. For the 
                  Ultimaker S5, the "Normal - 0.15 mm" profile was used and for the Prusa MK3 the "0.15mm QUALITY" profile. All parts were printed without 
                  supports
                </p>
                <div
                  style="display: inline-block; text-align: center; margin-left: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 5px; padding: 5px; vertical-align: top;">

                <p>
                  After the manufacturing, we could assemble everything. This was done by inserting the laser cut mounts onto the baseplate and fixing their 
                  position with the corner stabilizers. Next, the rail slide was mounted and lastly the feet. The photo below already shows the egg holder, the 
                  translation stage and the pen holder in place.

                <h2>Electronic Design</h2>
                <p>
                  The electronics were designed by <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/bottrop/students/jona-breitenbach/assignments/week10.html">Jona</a>
                  from the FabLab Bottrop. Please refer to his site for more details as below, only a summary is give.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For designing the PCB, an old <a href="https://egg-bot.com/">Egg-Bot</a> design from 1990 was used as a reference. The old project works on a small PIC
                  microcontroller, and since that seems to be enough, a more modern, a lot faster dsPIC was used. For stepper drivers, the A4988 from
                  Allegro was used since it has been used not only in the old Egg-Bot design, but also at both FabLabs involved in the project.
                  Servo outputs were added to give the cheap servos the control voltage they need, and the whole project needed three different
                  supply voltages - 12 to 24 volts for the steppers, 5 to 10 volts for the servo, and 3.3V for the microcontroller.
                  Voltage regulators for 5V and 3.3V were taken from what was there, with the 5V regulators being leftovers from a FabAcademy
                  project of one of the instructors.

                  A Circuit Board was designed and made, with everything the project should need and some parts (like a second servo output) to spare
                  for growth of the machine. Milling the board worked fine. The produced board is shown below.

                  However, some hidden problems came up during stuffing - the microcontroller was
                  just slightly rotated (probably when pulling the board from the hotplate), so one side of the QFN was not properly contacted. This was
                  only found long after all the pin headers were soldered in, so going back onto the hotplate was impossible. Trying to repair this with hot
                  air killed the microcontroller, replacing the microcontroller killed the PCB, so it will have to be redone
                </p>

                <p>
                  Right now, we are waiting for new components to arrive to make a new board like this and hopefully not killing the microcontroller.

        <h1>Evaluation of the Execution</h1>
        <p>
          In general, the project went really well. However, the execution was not perfect. This was due to the fact that we had planned on using  
          certain components but instead used other components that were already available for us. This delayed the design phase and with it the other tasks 
          as well. Therefore, in contrast to our time management (see above), we assembled the mechanical parts on Tuesday (9th of April) and not on the Monday.
          Similarly, the PCB design was delayed and therefore we only brought everything together on the 9th of April. However, then, the board got fried. Therefore, 
          the complete machine is not done yet (edit from the 21st of april).

          <h2>Problem Solving in a Team</h2>
          <p>
            In general, there were only minor issues. First of all, we were already planning on using certain parts like a linear slide and 
            designed our parts around it until we figured out that we had similar but not the same components in the lab. This resulted among others 
            in redesigning several if not all mechanical parts. Here, the frame had to change drastically. However, the responsible person was unavailable 
            at this time already, which is why two of the team took over the part. This required working in parallel with good communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest problem was probably frying the PCB on the day before we had to present the machine. To overcome this problem in a team, Jona worked 
            with another person on fixing the PCB (we did not kno at this point that we could not rescue it) while the others worked on hardcoding several 
            shapes to draw on the egg-bot using a pre-made PCB, a breadboard, motor drivers and jumper cables. Here, we potentially waited slightly too long 
            with taking actions to work in parallel. Otherwise, we would not have had the time pressure later. Nevertheless, this gave us time to already do 
            some fun side-quests like the AI-generated music and an animated video. Therefore, this was a fun activity rising the motivation and happiness of 
            all group members.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, we think the group assignment worked relatively well without really much problems regarding the group's dynamic and communication. 
            During the initial phase of working on the individual tasks, everybody communicated well such that the interfaces of the tasks were fixed fast.

          <h2>Possible Improvements</h2>
          <p>
            Even though we are really happy with the outcome of the machine, there are some improvements that can be made. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For the pen holder and the final frame, please refer to 
            <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/frauke-wassmuth/assignments/assignment10.html">Frauke's</a> documentation, i.e. 
            <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/frauke-wassmuth/assignments/assignment10.html#evaluation-pen-holder">here</a> and
            <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/frauke-wassmuth/assignments/assignment10.html#evaluation-frame">here</a>, respectively.
            In summary, there was a minor issue as the pen holder allowed for some backlash when drawing on an egg and changing the direction. A possible 
            improvement would be to include a spring or just using a perfectly round rod for the hinge of the pen holder instead of the threaded M5 nut to alleviate 
            the present play in the joint. The frame appears to be a valid design but could be improved stability-wise for the baseplate.

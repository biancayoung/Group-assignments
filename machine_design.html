        <h2>Linear Motion System</h2>
        <p>In this chapter the design and fabrication of the linear motion system is shortly described. For any further information have a look into the individual page of 
            <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/sophia-doring/assignments/10MechanicalDMachineD.html"> Sophia Döring.</a></p>
        <p>The linear motion system enables the movement of the pen holder along the y.axis of the machine. There are several principles and designs existing to create linear motion.
            For the design we defined these specified requirements:
            <ol>
                <li>The linear motion of the rail must be a translation of the rotational movement generated by a NEMA 17 stepper motor</li>
                <li>The linear motion rail must offer high precision to ensure accurate movement of the pen along one degree of freedom</li>
                <li>Smooth motion is essential to prevent any jerky movements or inconsistencies in the plotted lines.</li>
                <li>The linear motion rail should provide secure attachment points or mounting options to the frame</li>
                <li>While meeting all the necessary requirements, the linear motion rail should also be cost-effective</li>


            </ol>
            
        As a spindle nut system with 1:1 gear ration to a stepper motor is common for plotter machine and 3D printers as well as meeting all the requirements, this system was 
    chosen for moving the pen holder. Additionally, to constrain any other degree of freedom a slider-rail system was chosen, also satisfying the defined requirements.</p>

          <img src="images/Week10/Shaftrail.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;">
        </div> <p>The rail system was not fabricated in the lab as only off-shelf components were used for the system.</p> <p>Utilizing resources available in the lab, I opted to incorporate a linear bearing and shaft to constrain the degrees
             of freedom. I proceeded by reverse-engineering 
            the critical dimensions of both the linear bearing and the shaft, were they would be connected to the penholder and the frame.</p>

      <h2>Pen Holder</h2>
      <p>To assess the optimal speed, power and frequency, we started with an estimate for these parameters from the manual. As there was no MDF present in the table, we went with the values for wood with a thickness of 3 mm, namely 30, 60 and 20 for speed, power and frequency. Hence, for the sample test, we started with a frequency of 20 and values for the speed of 20, 30 and 40 and for the power of 50, 60 and 70.</p>
      <p>However, we noticed that none of the squares were actually cut. Therefore, we repeated the sample test fo the same speed with a slightly higher frequency of 30 and a power of 80, 90 and 100.</p>

  <h2>Frame</h2>
  <p>The frame is the component to align and position all other components. Therefore, these requirements were defined:
    <ol>
        <li>The frame must incorporate designated mounting points to seamlessly accommodate the linear motion system, egg holder, and electronics. This ensures precise alignment and ease of assembly.</li>
        <li>It is imperative that the frame offers robust stability to securely hold all components in place during operation</li>
        <li>The frame design should incorporate a user-friendly system allowing for easy adjustment of the egg holder's length</li>
        <li>The frame should be lightweight and compact enough to be comfortably carried by two hands, facilitating relocation and deployment in different settings</li>
        <li>The frame design should prioritize simplicity and ease of fabrication to minimize production time</li>
        <li> Opting for materials and manufacturing techniques that strike a balance between affordability and performance ensures that the frame remains budget-friendly without compromising on quality or functionality.</li>


    </ol>
    The design was created in Fusion360. As tool of fabrication we decided to use laser cutting and 3D printing. 
    The design was split up in two parts as the length adjustment system of the egg holder provided a point of complexisity in the design of the frame.
  </p>
  <p>The adjustable length system was design by  <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/kamplintfort/students/sophia-doring/assignments/10MechanicalDMachineD.html"> Sophia Döring</a>. For any 
further information of the design look on her individual page. The additional requirements for this part of the frame were defined as:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The system must be capable of adjusting to a length of 55 mm</li>
    <li>Tolerance for adjustment should be within 5 mm</li>
    <li>User-friendly</li>
    <li>Stability is essential to support the weight of an egg without risk of tipping</li>
    <li>Should withstand the forces from the spring forces (egg holder)</li>

</ol>
<p>As design a simple rail slide system was incorporated with the functionality of rotating the slide in a way to interlock with the rail.</p>
<p> The design was created in Fusion360 and fabricated with an Ultimaker S5 and an Ender 3 v2.</p>
